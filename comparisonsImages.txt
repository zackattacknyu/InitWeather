Each row shows the least error images and uses a different method
The first image is always that base image since it would have the least error with itself

From top to bottom
Row 1: Mean Squared Error
Row 2: Mean Error
Row 3: Classification Error (you bin the mm/hr values and see how much error there is)
Row 4: Classification Distance Error (bin the values, then do mean error on binned values)
Row 5: Classification MSE (bin the values, do mse on binned values)

Values range from 0 to 9097

In comparisons1,
For the binning, they were put into 91 bins, thus each was separated by 0.1 mm

In comparisons2,
For the binning, they were put into 9 bins, thus each was separated by 1 mm
